Rails Intro Project - Step-by-Step Instructions
==============================================

This document outlines the complete process of building a Rails book library application from scratch, meeting all the rubric requirements for data gathering, web navigation, searching, markup, models, and seeding.

## Project Setup
1. Created a new Rails application: `rails new IntroToRails`
2. Changed to project directory: `cd IntroToRails`
3. Added required gems to Gemfile:
   - `gem 'faker'` for generating fake data
   - `gem 'kaminari'` for pagination
   - `gem 'bootstrap-sass'` for styling
4. Ran `bundle install` to install dependencies

## Database Design & Models
1. Created Author model: `rails generate model Author name:string bio:text`
2. Created Genre model: `rails generate model Genre name:string description:text`
3. Created Book model: `rails generate model Book title:string description:text published_year:integer author:references`
4. Created BookGenre join model: `rails generate model BookGenre book:references genre:references`
5. Created Library model: `rails generate scaffold Library name:string address:text latitude:decimal longitude:decimal phone:string website:string`
6. Added validations to models:
   - Author: presence of name, uniqueness of name
   - Genre: presence of name, uniqueness of name
   - Book: presence of title, description, published_year; numericality of published_year
   - BookGenre: presence of book_id and genre_id
   - Library: presence of name, address, latitude, longitude, phone, website; latitude/longitude numericality within valid ranges
7. Set up associations:
   - Author has_many books
   - Book belongs_to author
   - Book has_many genres through book_genres
   - Genre has_many books through book_genres

## Controllers & Routes
1. Generated controllers:
   - `rails generate controller Books`
   - `rails generate controller Authors`
   - `rails generate controller Genres`
   - `rails generate controller Pages`
   - `rails generate scaffold Library name:string address:text latitude:decimal longitude:decimal phone:string website:string`
2. Set up routes in config/routes.rb:
   - Root route to books#index
   - Resources for books, authors, genres, libraries
   - Custom route for pages/about
3. Implemented controller actions:
   - BooksController: index, show, edit, update, destroy
   - AuthorsController: index, show
   - GenresController: index, show
   - LibrariesController: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy
   - PagesController: about

## Views & Layout
1. Created application layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb):
   - Bootstrap CSS link
   - Navigation bar with links to Home, Books, Authors, Genres, Libraries, About
   - Container div for content
2. Created Books views:
   - index.html.erb: List of books with search/filter forms, pagination
   - show.html.erb: Detailed book view with author/genre sidebars
   - _book.html.erb: Partial for displaying book information
   - new.html.erb, edit.html.erb, _form.html.erb: CRUD forms
3. Created Authors views:
   - index.html.erb: List of authors
   - show.html.erb: Author details with their books
   - _author.html.erb: Author partial
4. Created Genres views:
   - index.html.erb: List of genres
   - show.html.erb: Genre details with associated books
   - _genre.html.erb: Genre partial
5. Created Libraries views:
   - index.html.erb: Interactive map with library locations, sidebar with library list
   - show.html.erb, new.html.erb, edit.html.erb, _form.html.erb: CRUD views
   - _library.html.erb: Library partial
6. Created About page (app/views/pages/about.html.erb):
   - Explains data sources and ERD

## Data Seeding
1. Created db/seeds.rb with four data sources:
   - Faker for authors and genres
   - CSV file for book data (created lib/books.csv)
   - CSV file for library data (created lib/libraries.csv)
   - Additional Faker for more books and libraries
2. Implemented seeding logic:
   - Create 10 genres with Faker
   - Create 50 authors with Faker
   - Read books from CSV and create Book records
   - Create additional 60 books with Faker
   - Assign random genres to books (2-3 per book)
   - Read libraries from CSV and create Library records
   - Create additional 10 libraries with Faker
3. Ran `rails db:migrate` to create tables
4. Ran `rails db:seed` to populate database

## Features Implementation
1. **Search**: Full-text search on title, description, and author name
2. **Filter**: Dropdown to filter books by genre
3. **Pagination**: Kaminari gem for 10 books per page
4. **Navigation**: Hierarchical navigation between index/show pages
5. **CRUD**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for books and libraries
6. **Associations**: Proper display of related data (author, genres)
7. **Mapping**: Google Maps integration showing library locations with markers and user geolocation

## Styling & UX
1. Bootstrap responsive design
2. Panel layouts for book listings
3. Form styling with Bootstrap classes
4. Navigation bar with active states
5. Button styling for actions

## Testing & Debugging
1. Started Rails server: `rails server`
2. Tested all pages and functionality:
   - Home page (books index)
   - Book show pages
   - Author and genre pages
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Pagination
   - CRUD operations
3. Fixed HTML escaping issue with genre links by using `raw()` helper
4. Verified all links work and data displays correctly

## Final Verification
- Database contains 110 books, 59 authors, 10 genres, 231 book-genre associations, 20 libraries
- All pages render correctly
- Search and filter work as expected
- Navigation is functional
- Bootstrap styling is applied
- Google Maps integration with library markers and geolocation
- About page explains the project structure

## Running the Application
1. Ensure Ruby and Rails are installed
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `rails db:migrate` to set up database
4. Run `rails db:seed` to populate data
5. Run `rails server` to start the application
6. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application
