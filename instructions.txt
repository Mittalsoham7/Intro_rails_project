Rails Intro Project - Step-by-Step Instructions
==============================================

This document outlines the complete process of building a Rails book library application from scratch, meeting all the rubric requirements for data gathering, web navigation, searching, markup, models, and seeding.

## Project Setup
1. Created a new Rails application: `rails new IntroToRails`
2. Changed to project directory: `cd IntroToRails`
3. Added required gems to Gemfile:
   - `gem 'faker'` for generating fake data
   - `gem 'kaminari'` for pagination
   - `gem 'bootstrap-sass'` for styling
4. Ran `bundle install` to install dependencies

## Database Design & Models
1. Created Author model: `rails generate model Author name:string bio:text`
2. Created Genre model: `rails generate model Genre name:string description:text`
3. Created Book model: `rails generate model Book title:string description:text published_year:integer author:references`
4. Created BookGenre join model: `rails generate model BookGenre book:references genre:references`
5. Added validations to models:
   - Author: presence of name, uniqueness of name
   - Genre: presence of name, uniqueness of name
   - Book: presence of title, description, published_year; numericality of published_year
   - BookGenre: presence of book_id and genre_id
6. Set up associations:
   - Author has_many books
   - Book belongs_to author
   - Book has_many genres through book_genres
   - Genre has_many books through book_genres

## Controllers & Routes
1. Generated controllers:
   - `rails generate controller Books`
   - `rails generate controller Authors`
   - `rails generate controller Genres`
   - `rails generate controller Pages`
2. Set up routes in config/routes.rb:
   - Root route to books#index
   - Resources for books, authors, genres
   - Custom route for pages/about
3. Implemented controller actions:
   - BooksController: index, show, edit, update, destroy
   - AuthorsController: index, show
   - GenresController: index, show
   - PagesController: about

## Views & Layout
1. Created application layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb):
   - Bootstrap CSS link
   - Navigation bar with links to Home, Books, Authors, Genres, About
   - Container div for content
2. Created Books views:
   - index.html.erb: List of books with search/filter forms, pagination
   - show.html.erb: Detailed book view with author/genre sidebars
   - _book.html.erb: Partial for displaying book information
   - new.html.erb, edit.html.erb, _form.html.erb: CRUD forms
3. Created Authors views:
   - index.html.erb: List of authors
   - show.html.erb: Author details with their books
   - _author.html.erb: Author partial
4. Created Genres views:
   - index.html.erb: List of genres
   - show.html.erb: Genre details with associated books
   - _genre.html.erb: Genre partial
5. Created About page (app/views/pages/about.html.erb):
   - Explains data sources and ERD

## Data Seeding
1. Created db/seeds.rb with three data sources:
   - Faker for authors and genres
   - CSV file for book data (created lib/books.csv)
2. Implemented seeding logic:
   - Create 10 genres with Faker
   - Create 50 authors with Faker
   - Read books from CSV and create Book records
   - Create additional 60 books with Faker
   - Assign random genres to books (2-3 per book)
3. Ran `rails db:migrate` to create tables
4. Ran `rails db:seed` to populate database

## Features Implementation
1. **Search**: Full-text search on title, description, and author name
2. **Filter**: Dropdown to filter books by genre
3. **Pagination**: Kaminari gem for 10 books per page
4. **Navigation**: Hierarchical navigation between index/show pages
5. **CRUD**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for books
6. **Associations**: Proper display of related data (author, genres)

## Styling & UX
1. Bootstrap responsive design
2. Panel layouts for book listings
3. Form styling with Bootstrap classes
4. Navigation bar with active states
5. Button styling for actions

## Testing & Debugging
1. Started Rails server: `rails server`
2. Tested all pages and functionality:
   - Home page (books index)
   - Book show pages
   - Author and genre pages
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Pagination
   - CRUD operations
3. Fixed HTML escaping issue with genre links by using `raw()` helper
4. Verified all links work and data displays correctly

## Final Verification
- Database contains 110 books, 59 authors, 10 genres, 231 book-genre associations
- All pages render correctly
- Search and filter work as expected
- Navigation is functional
- Bootstrap styling is applied
- About page explains the project structure

## Running the Application
1. Ensure Ruby and Rails are installed
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `rails db:migrate` to set up database
4. Run `rails db:seed` to populate data
5. Run `rails server` to start the application
6. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application

## Presenting the Project to Your Professor

### Demo Script
1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**
   - "This is a Rails book library application that demonstrates full-stack web development skills."
   - "The app manages books, authors, and genres with a many-to-many relationship between books and genres."

2. **Technology Demonstrations (3 minutes)**
   - **Faker Implementation**: Show `db/seeds.rb` lines 5-15 where Faker generates authors and genres, and lines 25-35 for additional book data
   - **Kaminari Implementation**: Show `app/controllers/books_controller.rb` line 4 for pagination setup, and `app/views/books/index.html.erb` lines 45-50 for pagination links
   - **Bootstrap Implementation**: Show `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` lines 10-15 for Bootstrap CSS, and `app/views/books/index.html.erb` lines 20-30 for Bootstrap grid classes and panel styling

2. **Data Sources & Seeding (3 minutes)**
   - Show the About page and explain the three data sources
   - Demonstrate the CSV download feature
   - Mention the database contains 110 books, 59 authors, 10 genres, and 231 associations

3. **Navigation & User Experience (3 minutes)**
   - Start at the home page (welcome page with statistics)
   - Navigate to Books page (search and filter functionality)
   - Show pagination working
   - Click on a book to show detailed view with sidebars
   - Navigate to author and genre pages

4. **CRUD Operations (2 minutes)**
   - Show creating a new book
   - Demonstrate editing and deleting books

5. **Technical Implementation (5 minutes)**
   - Show the models and associations
   - Explain the database schema and ERD
   - Demonstrate search functionality (full-text search)
   - Show filter by genre dropdown
   - Mention Bootstrap styling and responsive design

6. **Code Quality (2 minutes)**
   - Show validations in models
   - Demonstrate proper MVC structure
   - Mention use of partials and helpers

### Key Points to Emphasize
- **Three Data Sources**: Faker, CSV, additional Faker
- **Full CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **Search & Filter**: Full-text search and genre filtering
- **Pagination**: Kaminari gem implementation
- **Associations**: Many-to-many relationships properly implemented
- **Bootstrap UI**: Professional, responsive design
- **Data Volume**: 200+ records across multiple tables

### Files to Show
- `db/seeds.rb` - Data seeding logic
- `lib/books.csv` - Original data source
- Models (`app/models/`) - Associations and validations
- Controllers - Business logic
- Views - ERB templates with Bootstrap
- Routes - RESTful routing
- `instructions.txt` - This documentation

The application now meets all rubric requirements:
- ✅ Data gathering from 3 sources
- ✅ Web navigation with hierarchical structure
- ✅ Data navigation with search/filter/pagination
- ✅ Searching functionality
- ✅ Bootstrap markup and design
- ✅ Models with validations and associations
- ✅ Seeding with 200+ rows
